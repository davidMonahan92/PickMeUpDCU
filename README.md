# PickMeUpDCU
PickMeUpDCU is an interactive carpooling web application aimed at all students and faculty members of DCU, It is fully accessible to be used on all platforms.

It provides the user with the option to be either a passenger or a driver and on the app other users that are nearby are displayed on a map with directions provided to the users. 

The passenger makes a request to any active nearby drivers and the driver can either accept or reject 
the request. If the driver accepts the request directions are provided to the passenger on the map or in written form. The application 
also provides both parties with all travel details, like fuel costs measured by the distance of the whole journey, so they can finalise 
a fair price. 

This app was designed to also help reduce the number of cars on the road and reduce emmisions.
